# Welcome to DataOpsFusion

## 💻 Hey there! 

Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I share my journey with **Data**, **DevOps**, and **AI**. I'm just someone who loves building things with code and learning from the amazing tech community.

This blog is where I document what I'm working on, share things I've learned (usually the hard way!), and hopefully help others who might be on a similar path.

For example, using GPT-4o-mini-high for daily conversation is overkill, and GPT models for image generation are not as effective as specialized tools like Sora.
