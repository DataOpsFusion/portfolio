# About Me

## 💻 Hi, I'm Dave

I am an international student studying in Canada, majoring in Computer Science. I hope to get to know you and share some of the things I love doing that might help you in the future. What started as curiosity about how websites work has evolved into a journey through data pipelines, infrastructure automation, and AI experiments.

## 🎯 My Story

Everything started when I began studying for the CompTIA A+ Core 1 exam. At that point, I had never seen a CPU in real life. At the beginning of my semesters, I was loaded with lots of expectations—learning what a motherboard is, how many pins a power supply has, what a SATA cable is, and even what an ATX form factor means.

I decided to buy a used computer on Amazon to learn hands-on. Fast forward to now, I have my own cluster with 4 separate nodes featuring full high availability and quarterly backups on AWS. With primary DNS, DHCP, file server, and code server running at 99% uptime, it’s been quite a journey. I’ve learned a lot, and I want to help you enjoy this journey at least in some way.

Don’t worry—starting with an old 10-year-old Linux machine is probably enough for 99% of tasks.

### What I'm Passionate About

For me, I love learning new things—not to brag but to understand how things work. In the worst-case scenario, like a full-blown apocalypse, I want to know how to build and fix stuff.

### Outside of Tech

I love art, even though I can’t draw. I admire how powerful it is at capturing everything on the canvas. In addition, I love music because it’s a universal language that doesn’t require speaking a single word—something truly remarkable.

## 🛠️ What I Work With

I primarily work with Bash and infrastructure as code, and I use Python for machine learning and AI. I can write some R code, but I don’t consider it my strong suit.

**Currently Learning:**

- Excel — In my opinion, it’s one of the most underrated tools. Even as a programmer proficient in writing code, I often find myself collaborating with coworkers who rely on Excel. Having a common ground is essential.
- Math and Statistics — Essential for advanced learning and understanding data deeply.
- Cloud platforms — Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.

**Comfortable With:**

- Jupyter Notebook for interactive coding and experiments
- Docker for containerization and deployment
- Ollama for local large language models
- Linux for server and desktop environments
- Ansible and Terraform for infrastructure automation and management
- Machine Learning and Deep Learning frameworks and workflows

**Have Played Around With:**

- Kubernetes
- GitOps workflows
- Various scripting languages like PowerShell and Perl

## 🧠 My Learning Philosophy

I prefer to understand *why* something is done rather than just *how*, because two people solving the same problem—like a senior developer versus an intern—may do it very differently. Knowing these differences tells a lot about a person’s approach and experience.
