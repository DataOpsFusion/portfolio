# Model Deployment

Practical guides for deploying ML models to production - from simple web apps to enterprise-scale systems.

## Deployment Options Overview

There's no one-size-fits-all deployment strategy. Here's when to use what:

### üåê Web API Deployment
**When to use**: Real-time predictions, web applications, mobile apps
- FastAPI + Docker
- Flask for simple cases
- Load balancing strategies

### ‚ö° Batch Processing
**When to use**: Large datasets, scheduled predictions, ETL pipelines
- Apache Spark
- Airflow workflows
- Cloud batch services

### üîÑ Streaming Predictions
**When to use**: Real-time events, IoT data, live recommendations
- Kafka + ML models
- Stream processing frameworks
- Edge deployment

## Deployment Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple API Service
Perfect for MVPs and small-scale applications.

```python
# Example FastAPI deployment
from fastapi import FastAPI
import joblib

app = FastAPI()
model = joblib.load("model.pkl")

@app.post("/predict")
def predict(data: dict):
    prediction = model.predict([data])
    return {"prediction": prediction.tolist()}
```

### Pattern 2: Microservices Architecture
For complex applications with multiple models.

- Model serving containers
- API gateway
- Service discovery
- Circuit breakers

### Pattern 3: Serverless Deployment
Cost-effective for sporadic usage patterns.

- AWS Lambda
- Google Cloud Functions
- Azure Functions

## Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling
- When to scale up vs scale out
- Auto-scaling strategies
- Cost optimization

### Caching Strategies
- Redis for model caching
- Feature caching patterns
- Result caching

### Model Versioning in Production
- Blue-green deployments
- Canary releases
- Rollback strategies

## Hands-On Tutorials

Each section includes:
- Step-by-step deployment guides
- Docker configurations
- Monitoring setup
- Performance optimization tips
