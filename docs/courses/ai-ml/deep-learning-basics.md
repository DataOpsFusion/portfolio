# Deep Learning Basics

A practical introduction to neural networks and deep learning - no PhD required!

## What We'll Cover

This course takes you from zero to building your first neural network. We'll keep it practical and focus on understanding concepts through hands-on examples.

### Course Outline

1. **What is Deep Learning?**
   - Neural networks explained simply
   - When to use deep learning vs traditional ML
   - Real-world applications

2. **Building Your First Neural Network**
   - Setting up your environment
   - Creating a simple perceptron
   - Training your first model

3. **Understanding Backpropagation**
   - How neural networks learn
   - Gradient descent made simple
   - Common pitfalls and solutions

4. **Improving Your Models**
   - Activation functions
   - Loss functions
   - Optimization techniques

5. **Going Deeper**
   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
   - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
   - Transfer learning

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- High school math (we'll explain the rest)
- Curiosity and patience!

## Tools We'll Use

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Google Colab (free GPU access)
