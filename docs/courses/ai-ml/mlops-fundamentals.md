# MLOps Fundamentals

Learn how to take your ML models from Jupyter notebooks to production systems that actually work in the real world.

## Why MLOps Matters

I've seen too many great ML models die in notebooks. MLOps is about building systems that are:
- **Reliable** - They work when you need them
- **Scalable** - They handle real-world data volumes
- **Maintainable** - You can update them without breaking everything
- **Monitored** - You know when something goes wrong

## Course Structure

### Part 1: Version Control for ML
- Git for data scientists
- DVC for data versioning
- Model versioning strategies
- Experiment tracking with MLflow

### Part 2: Building ML Pipelines
- Pipeline design patterns
- Data validation and testing
- Feature stores
- Model training automation

### Part 3: Model Deployment
- Containerization with Docker
- API development with FastAPI
- Cloud deployment strategies
- A/B testing for models

### Part 4: Monitoring & Maintenance
- Model performance monitoring
- Data drift detection
- Automated retraining
- Incident response

## Real-World Project

Throughout the course, we'll build a complete MLOps pipeline for a recommendation system, from data ingestion to production deployment.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Version Control**: Git, DVC
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow, Weights & Biases
- **Orchestration**: Apache Airflow, Prefect
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes, FastAPI
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, custom dashboards

*This course is based on patterns I've implemented across multiple production ML systems. Real experience, real problems, real solutions.*
