# Pipeline Design

Learn to build data pipelines that don't break at 3 AM and won't make you hate your life.

## Philosophy: Simple, Reliable, Observable

Good pipeline design is about:
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and modify
- **Reliability**: Handles failures gracefully
- **Observability**: You know what's happening

## Pipeline Patterns

### Pattern 1: Batch ETL
The classic approach - extract, transform, load.

**When to use**: 
- Daily/weekly reporting
- Historical data processing
- Complex transformations

**Tools**: Airflow, dbt, Spark

### Pattern 2: Streaming ETL
Real-time data processing for immediate insights.

**When to use**:
- Real-time dashboards
- Fraud detection
- Live recommendations

**Tools**: Kafka, Flink, Kinesis

### Pattern 3: Lambda Architecture
Combine batch and stream processing.

**When to use**:
- Need both real-time and historical views
- Complex analytics requirements
- High-volume data

### Pattern 4: Kappa Architecture
Stream-first approach with reprocessing capability.

**When to use**:
- Primarily real-time requirements
- Simpler than Lambda
- Event-driven architecture

## Design Principles

### 1. Idempotency
Your pipeline should produce the same result if run multiple times.

```python
# Bad: Appends data every run
INSERT INTO daily_sales VALUES (...)

# Good: Upsert pattern
INSERT INTO daily_sales VALUES (...) 
ON CONFLICT (date) DO UPDATE SET ...
```

### 2. Error Handling
Plan for failures because they will happen.

- Dead letter queues
- Retry strategies
- Circuit breakers
- Graceful degradation

### 3. Monitoring & Alerting
Know when things break before your users do.

- Data freshness checks
- Volume anomaly detection
- Schema evolution monitoring
- SLA tracking

### 4. Scalability
Design for tomorrow's data volume, not today's.

- Partitioning strategies
- Horizontal scaling
- Resource optimization
- Cost management

## Hands-On Projects

### Project 1: E-commerce Analytics Pipeline
Build a complete pipeline processing:
- User events from web/mobile
- Transaction data from databases
- Product catalog updates
- Real-time recommendations

### Project 2: IoT Data Processing
Handle sensor data at scale:
- Time-series data ingestion
- Real-time anomaly detection
- Historical trend analysis
- Predictive maintenance alerts

### Project 3: Social Media Analytics
Process social media data:
- API data ingestion
- Sentiment analysis pipeline
- Trend detection
- Influence scoring
